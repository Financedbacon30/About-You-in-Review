        <p>My name is Jordan, and I'm studying Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security. <br>
        I was born and raised in Utah, and moved out here when I was 19. I moved back to Utah, but I met my wife here and she convinced me to move back. <br>
        When I first graduated I planned to study buisness, but after taking a leave of absence I realized I didn't want to go back to studying business. 
        <br>After getting married, I realized I should go back to school, and my brother-in-law got me interested in computers and doing more with them. 
        <br>I hope to get into a company possibly doing a little bit of both programming and cyber security. Or trying both and figuring out which side of computers I like more.
